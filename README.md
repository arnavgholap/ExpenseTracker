This Expense Tracker application was built out of a personal need to manage finances more effectively. I struggled with keeping track of daily expenditures and realized that many others face similar challenges. This application aims to simplify expense tracking, helping millions like me to categorize, analyze, and manage their spending effortlessly.

By providing a clear and user-friendly interface, I hope to solve the common problem of financial disorganization and empower users to take control of their finances, leading to better financial decisions and reduced stress.

Using the Expense Tracker is simple:

Select a category from the dropdown menu that best describes your expense.
Enter the amount spent in the "Amount" input field.

Click the "Add" button to record the expense.
Each entry will appear in the expenses list below. You can view the total amount spent and delete individual entries if needed.
